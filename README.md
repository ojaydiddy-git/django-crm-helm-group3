# django-crm-helm
django crm from docker compose to helm chart

To run this with `docker compose`:

1. Edit the file patch-settings.diff to have your hostname and url:

```diff
 # Add your hosts to the list.
-ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']
-
+ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', 'codespace-dev.k3p.dev']
+CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=['https://codespace-dev.k3p.dev']

```

```bash
cp django-crm/webcrm/settings.py .
patch <patch-settings.diff
ansible-playbook up.yml
```

This will create the database. The first time you run this you will need to create a super user account.

```bash
docker compose exec crm sh -c "python manage.py setupdata"
```

This will display a super user name and password. Save this somewhere as it can't be re-retrieved. The admin interface will be at `/en/456-admin/` and the regular at `/en/123`.

## Marks

Part 1. Create a repository on one of your gitea(s) by cloning [this repository](https://github.com/rhildred/django-crm-helm), (or atomic crm, if you have it working already). Add your teammates as collaborators (4 marks)

Part 2. Use one student's truenas for nfs storage for your database. You can use [this article](https://www.dontpanicblog.co.uk/2024/12/20/nfs-shares-in-docker/) to help (4 marks)

Part 3. Create a jenkinsfile or gitea action that updates the image from the included Dockerfile on your gitea docker image repository (see [this article](https://docs.gitea.com/usage/packages/container)) every time code is pushed (4 marks)

Part 4. Use a cloudflared ingress to expose your crm from your cluster to the internet (4 marks)

Part 5. Consume the docker image from step 3 in your docker-compose.yml, use Kompose to create a helm chart and modify up.yaml and down.yaml to run your image on kubernetes and expose it with a cloudflared tunnel (4 marks).

Total. 20

I hope that this works better than what I had before. Notice that I started with the mysql setup that you are used to from PROG8850. Hopefully the docker-compose.yml file will take you from working code to working code!
